# Movie Database API

## Problem Statement
The idea for this API came from the issue of not being able to find or decide on a movie. This API will be have a database of all different types of movies along with details that include: description, genre, rating, release year, director, etc. The RESTful Web Service will allow users to get movies based on things such as: 
* Searching for a movie title
* Filtering on genres, ratings, release years, directors etc
* Amount of movies they want to receive 
* Generate a random movie
